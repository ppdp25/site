# PPDP 2025

Welcome to the 27th International Symposium on Principles and Practice of
Declarative Programming. PPDP will be co-located with [ICLP
2025](https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/) and held on 10-11 September 2025 at the
University of Calabria, Rende, Italy.

## Scope

The PPDP 2025 symposium brings together researchers from the declarative
programming communities, including those working in the functional, logic,
answer-set, and constraint handling programming paradigms. The goal is to
stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for analyzing,
performing, specifying, and reasoning about computations, including mechanisms
for concurrency, security, static analysis, and verification.

Submissions are invited on all topics related to declarative programming, from
principles to practice, from foundations to applications. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

- Language Design: domain-specific languages; interoperability; concurrency,
  parallelism and distribution; modules; functional languages; reactive
  languages; languages with objects; languages for quantum computing; languages
  inspired by biological and chemical computation; metaprogramming.

- Declarative languages in artificial intelligence: logic programming; database
  languages; knowledge representation languages; probabilistic languages;
  differentiable languages.

- Implementations: abstract machines; interpreters; compilation; compile-time
  and run-time optimization; memory management.

- Foundations: types; logical frameworks; monads and effects; semantics.

- Analysis and Transformation: partial evaluation; abstract interpretation;
  control flow; data flow; information flow; termination analysis; resource
  analysis; type inference and type checking; verification; validation;
  debugging; testing.

- Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments; verification
  tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive theorem provers;
  certification; novel applications of declarative programming inside and
  outside of CS; declarative programming pearls; practical experience reports
  and industrial application; education.

## Call for Papers

Submissions can be made in three categories:

- Regular Research Papers,
- System Descriptions, and
- Experience Reports.

Submissions of Research Papers must present original research which is
unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages ACM
style 2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography). Work that
already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions). Research
papers will be judged on originality, significance, correctness, clarity, and
readability.

Submission of System Descriptions must describe a working system whose
description has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed
10 pages and should contain a link to a working system. System Descriptions
must be marked as such at the time of submission and will be judged on
originality, significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.

Submissions of Experience Reports are meant to help create a body of published,
refereed, citable evidence where declarative programming such as functional,
logic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc., is used in practice. They must
not exceed 5 pages **including references**. Experience Reports must be marked
as such at the time of submission and need not report original research
results. They will be judged on significance, usefulness, clarity, and
readability.

Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to:

- insights gained from real-world projects using declarative programming

- comparison of declarative programming with conventional programming in the
  context of an industrial project or a university curriculum

- curricular issues encountered when using declarative programming in education

- real-world constraints that created special challenges for an implementation
  of a declarative language or for declarative programming in general

- novel use of declarative programming in the classroom

- programming pearl that illustrates a nifty new data structure or programming
  technique.

Supplementary material may be provided via a link to an extended version of the
submission (recommended), or in a clearly marked appendix beyond the
above-mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to study extended
versions or any material beyond the respective page limit. Material beyond the
page limit will not be included in the final published version.

## Format of a submission

For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of the
[Current ACM Master
Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template), 
 at the time of writing being 2.12. You must use the
LaTeX sigconf proceedings template, as the conference organizers are
unable to process final submissions in other formats. In case of
problems with the templates, contact [ACM's TeX support team at
Aptara](mailto:acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com).

Authors should note [ACM's statement on author's
rights](http://authors.acm.org/) which apply to final papers.
Submitted papers should meet the requirements of [ACM's plagiarism
policy](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy).

## Requirements for publication

At least one author of each accepted submission will be expected to
attend and present the work at the conference. The PC chair may
retract a paper that is not presented. The PC chair may also retract a
paper if complaints about the paper's correctness are raised which
cannot be resolved by the final paper deadline.

## Review process
The reviewing is single-blind, with a two-days rebuttal phase.
