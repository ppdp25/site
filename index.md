## Overview

The PPDP 2025 symposium brings together researchers from the declarative
programming communities, including those working in the functional, logic,
answer-set, and constraint handling programming paradigms. The goal is to

performing, specifying, and reasoning about computations, including mechanisms
for concurrency, security, static analysis, and verification.
