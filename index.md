## Overview

The PPDP 2025 symposium brings together researchers from the declarative
programming communities, including those working in the functional, logic,
answer-set, and constraint handling programming paradigms. The goal is to
stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for analyzing,
performing, specifying, and reasoning about computations, including mechanisms
for concurrency, security, static analysis, and verification.
